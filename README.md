## GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

GSAP is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It allows you to animate HTML elements, SVGs, and JavaScript objects efficiently.

### 📌 What is Animation?

Animation is the process of creating the illusion of movement by changing an object's properties over time. GSAP makes this process smooth and easy with its powerful API.

### 📌 GSAP Introduction

GSAP provides a robust set of tools to animate elements on the web with precision and performance. It is widely used for UI/UX animations, game development, and interactive web experiences.

### 📌 GSAP Animation Basics

GSAP uses methods like gsap.to(), gsap.from(), and gsap.fromTo() to animate elements.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>GSAP Animation</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="box" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>
    <script>
        gsap.to("#box", { x: 300, duration: 2 });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 📌 GSAP Methods

- **gsap.to()**

Moves an element from its current state to a new state.

```javascript
gsap.to(".box", { x: 200, duration: 1, opacity: 0.5 });
```

- **gsap.from()**

Starts an element from a specified state and animates it to its natural state.

```javascript
gsap.from(".box", { x: -200, duration: 1, opacity: 0 });
```

- **gsap.fromTo()**

Defines both the starting and ending states.

```javascript
gsap.fromTo(".box", { x: -200, opacity: 0 }, { x: 200, opacity: 1, duration: 1 });
```

### 📌 GSAP Timeline & Control

GSAP timelines allow sequencing multiple animations with precise control.

```javascript
let tl = gsap.timeline();
tl.to(".box", { x: 100, duration: 1 })
  .to(".box", { y: 100, duration: 1 });
```

### 📌 GSAP ScrollTrigger

ScrollTrigger enables animations that react to scrolling.

```javascript
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
gsap.to(".box", {
  scrollTrigger: ".box",
  x: 300,
  duration: 2
});
```
